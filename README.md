# PrologTutorial
A tutorial explaining the AI programming language Prolog

Prolog is a fun and easy programming language to learn. It serves a very important role in artificial inteligence. It is a programming language made for artificial inteligence rather than an AI algorithm made for programming languages. Prolog answers questions based on the knowledge given unlike most other programming languages which perform actions based on instructions given. You might not be able to use Prolog to solve your math homework for you, but the language is great for deducing relations between objects (Geeks for Geeks).
